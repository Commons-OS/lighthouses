## Overview

Buurtzorg (Dutch for "neighborhood care") was founded in 2006 by Jos de Blok, a former nurse who was frustrated with the bureaucratic, task-oriented approach to home healthcare that had become dominant in the Netherlands. What started with 4 nurses has grown to over 15,000 nurses organized in approximately 1,000 self-managing teams.

## The Model

Each Buurtzorg team consists of up to 12 nurses who are fully responsible for providing care to a specific neighborhood (40-60 patients). Teams handle their own:

- **Patient intake and care planning**
- **Scheduling and coordination**
- **Hiring and training**
- **Quality improvement**
- **Financial management**

There are no managers. The central office of about 50 people provides support functions (IT, finance, training) but does not direct the teams.

## Commons Patterns in Action

### Self-Managing Teams
Teams operate with full autonomy. They make decisions by consent, not consensus — meaning proposals move forward unless someone has a principled objection. This is a practical application of **Sociocratic** principles.

### Neighborhood Care
Buurtzorg returns to the original model of district nursing, where nurses know their patients and community deeply. This creates **relational continuity** — the same nurse sees the same patient, building trust and understanding.

### Purpose Over Profit
The organization exists to help patients become as independent as possible, even though this reduces billable hours. This **purpose-driven** approach has paradoxically made Buurtzorg highly efficient.

### Minimal Bureaucracy
With no middle management, overhead costs are minimal. Nurses spend 60%+ of their time on direct patient care, compared to 35% in traditional organizations.

## Impact & Results

- **Patient satisfaction**: Highest in the Netherlands
- **Employee satisfaction**: Consistently ranked best employer in healthcare
- **Cost efficiency**: 40% lower costs than traditional providers
- **Quality outcomes**: Patients recover faster and require fewer hours of care
- **Growth**: From 4 to 15,000+ nurses in 15 years, entirely through word-of-mouth

## Lessons for Commons Engineers

1. **Trust works**: When you trust professionals to do their job, they exceed expectations
2. **Small is beautiful**: Teams of 10-12 are optimal for self-management
3. **Purpose attracts talent**: People want meaningful work, not just a paycheck
4. **Less management = more care**: Bureaucracy serves the organization, not the mission
5. **Replication through principles**: Buurtzorg's model has been adapted in 25+ countries

## Challenges & Criticisms

- **Scaling tensions**: As the organization grows, maintaining culture becomes harder
- **Not for everyone**: Some nurses prefer more structure and clear hierarchy
- **Healthcare system friction**: Operating within traditional reimbursement systems creates constraints
- **Founder dependency**: Jos de Blok's vision and leadership remain central

## The Buurtzorg Way

> "Humanity over bureaucracy. If you give nurses the freedom to provide the care they believe is needed, you get better outcomes for patients, happier nurses, and lower costs. It's not complicated — it's just different."
