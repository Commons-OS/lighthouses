## Overview

Vienna consistently ranks as one of the world's most livable cities, and housing is central to that success. Unlike most Western cities where housing has become a speculative asset, Vienna treats housing as a public good. Approximately 60% of Viennese residents live in some form of subsidized housing — either in municipal apartments (Gemeindebau) or limited-profit housing associations.

## The Model

### Municipal Housing (Gemeindebau)
The city of Vienna directly owns and manages approximately 220,000 apartments housing 500,000 people. These aren't "projects" for the poor — they're quality housing for a broad range of incomes, often with courtyards, community spaces, and architectural distinction.

### Limited-Profit Housing Associations
Non-profit developers build and manage another 200,000+ apartments. They're required to reinvest profits into new housing, creating a self-sustaining system.

### Rent Regulation
Rents in social housing are capped at approximately €5-8 per square meter — a fraction of market rates in comparable cities.

### Income Mixing
Unlike public housing in many countries, Vienna's social housing serves a broad income range. A teacher might live next to a doctor next to a retiree.

## Commons Patterns in Action

### Social Housing as Commons
Housing is treated as shared infrastructure, not a commodity. The city maintains long-term ownership and stewardship.

### Public Land Banking
Vienna has maintained public ownership of land for over a century, preventing speculation and enabling affordable development.

### Mixed-Income Communities
By design, social housing serves diverse incomes. This prevents stigmatization and creates stable, integrated neighborhoods.

### Tenant Participation
Many housing complexes have tenant councils that participate in management decisions, from maintenance to community programs.

### Quality Public Space
Social housing includes generous common areas — courtyards, gardens, community rooms, playgrounds — that foster social connection.

### Integrated Urban Planning
Housing is planned alongside transit, schools, healthcare, and green space. The city thinks in systems, not silos.

## Impact & Results

- **60%** of residents in subsidized housing
- **€5-8/m²** average social housing rent (vs. €15+ market rate)
- **#1** livability ranking (Economist, multiple years)
- **Low homelessness** compared to peer cities
- **Social stability**: Housing security reduces stress and enables flourishing
- **Political stability**: Broad housing access creates cross-class coalition

## Historical Context

Vienna's housing model emerged from "Red Vienna" (1919-1934), when the Social Democratic city government built massive housing complexes for workers. The most famous, Karl-Marx-Hof, housed 5,000 people and included kindergartens, libraries, health clinics, and laundries.

This wasn't charity — it was a political project to demonstrate that workers deserved dignity and beauty, not just shelter.

## Lessons for Commons Engineers

1. **Public ownership enables long-term thinking**: No pressure to sell for short-term gain
2. **Mixed income prevents stigma**: Social housing for everyone, not just the poor
3. **Quality matters**: Beautiful, well-maintained housing builds pride and community
4. **Land is key**: Public land banking prevents speculation
5. **Political will is essential**: Vienna's model required sustained political commitment

## Challenges & Criticisms

- **Waiting lists**: High demand means long waits for municipal housing
- **Insider advantage**: Long-term residents have advantages over newcomers
- **Maintenance costs**: Aging housing stock requires ongoing investment
- **Immigration pressure**: Growing population strains the system
- **Political sustainability**: Model depends on continued political support

## The Vienna Way

> "Housing is too important to be left to the market. When you treat housing as a public good, you get stable communities, social cohesion, and a city that works for everyone — not just those who can afford market rents."

> — Michael Ludwig, Mayor of Vienna
