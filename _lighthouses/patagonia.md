## Overview

Patagonia was founded in 1973 by Yvon Chouinard, a rock climber who started making climbing gear in his backyard. What began as a small company making pitons evolved into a $1.5 billion outdoor apparel company — and in 2022, became something unprecedented: a company owned entirely by a trust and nonprofit dedicated to fighting climate change.

## The Ownership Transformation

In September 2022, Yvon Chouinard and his family transferred 100% of Patagonia's ownership to two entities:

- **Patagonia Purpose Trust** (2% voting stock): Ensures the company stays true to its values
- **Holdfast Collective** (98% non-voting stock): A nonprofit that receives all profits (~$100M/year) to fight climate change

"Earth is now our only shareholder."

## Commons Patterns in Action

### Purpose-Driven Business
Patagonia's mission statement evolved from "Build the best product" to "We're in business to save our home planet." Every decision is filtered through this purpose.

### Radical Transparency
The company publishes detailed information about its supply chain, environmental footprint, and challenges. The "Footprint Chronicles" allows customers to trace products back to their origins.

### Stakeholder Governance
Long before the ownership transfer, Patagonia operated as if it had obligations to employees, communities, suppliers, and the environment — not just shareholders.

### Regenerative Supply Chain
Patagonia invests in regenerative organic agriculture, fair trade certification, and circular economy initiatives (Worn Wear program for used gear).

### Environmental Activism
The company actively campaigns for environmental causes, sues the government over public lands, and encourages customers to "Don't Buy This Jacket" (a famous Black Friday ad urging reduced consumption).

## Impact & Results

- **1% for the Planet**: Founded by Chouinard, commits 1% of sales to environmental causes
- **$140M+** donated to environmental groups since 1985
- **B Corp certification** since 2012 (among the first)
- **Fair Trade certified** factories
- **100% renewable electricity** in US operations
- **Worn Wear**: Extends product life, reducing waste

## Key Innovations

### "Don't Buy This Jacket" (2011)
A Black Friday ad in the New York Times urging customers not to buy what they don't need. Paradoxically, it increased sales — but more importantly, started a conversation about conscious consumption.

### Worn Wear Program
Patagonia buys back used gear, repairs it, and resells it. They also provide free repairs and teach customers to fix their own gear. This extends product life and builds customer loyalty.

### Environmental Grants
Through 1% for the Planet and direct grants, Patagonia funds grassroots environmental groups that larger foundations often overlook.

## Lessons for Commons Engineers

1. **Profit can serve purpose**: A profitable business can be a vehicle for change
2. **Ownership matters**: The 2022 transfer shows how ownership structure shapes outcomes
3. **Authenticity builds trust**: Decades of consistent action created credibility
4. **Customers want meaning**: People pay premium prices for products aligned with their values
5. **Long-term thinking wins**: Patient capital and generational thinking enabled bold moves

## Challenges & Criticisms

- **Growth paradox**: Even sustainable growth has environmental impact
- **Premium pricing**: Products are expensive, limiting accessibility
- **Greenwashing accusations**: Some critics question whether any apparel company can be truly sustainable
- **Scale limitations**: The model may not work for all industries

## The Patagonia Way

> "I never wanted to be a businessman. But I've learned that business can be a force for good. Now, instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we're using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth."
