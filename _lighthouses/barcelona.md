## Overview

Barcelona has emerged as a global laboratory for urban innovation, particularly in digital democracy and technological sovereignty. Under the leadership of Mayor Ada Colau and the Barcelona en Comú movement (2015-present), the city has pioneered new approaches to citizen participation, data governance, and platform cooperativism.

## The Model

### Digital Sovereignty
Barcelona's "Digital City" strategy prioritizes open source software, data sovereignty, and ethical technology. The city views data as a public good, not a resource to be extracted by corporations.

### Decidim Platform
The city developed Decidim ("We Decide" in Catalan), an open-source participatory democracy platform now used by over 400 organizations worldwide. Citizens can propose ideas, debate policies, and vote on budgets.

### Participatory Budgeting
Residents directly decide how to spend a portion of the city budget through the Decidim platform. This creates direct democracy at scale.

### Platform Cooperativism
Barcelona supports cooperative alternatives to gig economy platforms, including Som Mobilitat (car sharing) and Katuma (food distribution).

## Commons Patterns in Action

### Digital Commons
Software, data, and digital infrastructure are treated as shared resources. The city uses and contributes to open source projects.

### Participatory Democracy
Citizens aren't just voters — they're active participants in governance through assemblies, consultations, and co-design processes.

### Data Sovereignty
The city negotiates with tech companies to ensure citizen data stays under public control. "Data is the new oil, and it should belong to the people."

### Municipalism
Barcelona is part of a global network of "fearless cities" that share strategies for progressive urban governance.

### Platform Cooperativism
Instead of fighting Uber and Airbnb, Barcelona supports cooperative alternatives that keep value in the community.

## Impact & Results

- **Decidim**: Used by 400+ organizations in 30+ countries
- **70,000+** participants in participatory processes
- **€30M+** in participatory budgeting
- **Open source first**: City prioritizes free software
- **Fearless Cities network**: 700+ municipalities worldwide
- **Superblocks**: Reclaiming streets from cars for people

## Key Innovations

### Decidim
An open-source platform for participatory democracy that enables proposals, debates, voting, and accountability tracking. It's now used from Helsinki to Mexico City.

### Superblocks (Superilles)
Redesigning neighborhoods to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars, creating more public space and reducing pollution.

### DECODE Project
A European research project led by Barcelona exploring how to give citizens control over their personal data.

### Barcelona Activa
The city's economic development agency supports cooperatives, social enterprises, and ethical businesses.

## Lessons for Commons Engineers

1. **Technology can serve democracy**: Digital tools can enhance, not replace, citizen participation
2. **Open source enables sovereignty**: Proprietary platforms create dependency
3. **Cities can lead**: Municipal governments can pioneer changes that national governments won't
4. **Networks amplify impact**: Fearless Cities shows how cities can learn from each other
5. **Prefigurative politics**: Build the alternative while fighting the status quo

## Challenges & Criticisms

- **Tourism pressure**: Mass tourism strains housing and public space
- **Political fragility**: Progressive coalitions are vulnerable to electoral shifts
- **Implementation gaps**: Ambitious policies don't always translate to street-level change
- **Tech limitations**: Digital participation can exclude those without access
- **Catalan tensions**: Regional politics complicate city governance

## The Barcelona Way

> "We are not just governing a city. We are building a new model of democracy — one where citizens are protagonists, not spectators. Technology should serve people, not the other way around."
> 
> — Ada Colau, Mayor of Barcelona
